## Project Overview

This app was a JavaScript/React capstone project created about 2 months after starting a fullstack web dev course with Nashville Software School.
It was required to have CRUD functionality, login/registration, ability for users to modify their own data but not that of others, etc..

I decided to create this game because I wanted to make something very different from the curriculum and because I've always liked John Conway's [*Game of Life*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) (<- Wikipedia link)

## Design Decision Explanations

The client is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.
I wrote a new backend with Django/SQLite shortly before deployment, a change from the json database it originally used.

This project was not intended to be made available publicly, but after several requests it's now deployed for all to enjoy.
